## About 

This GeoApps is very simple to use. The main objective is to make easier plotting chemical data about water. The outputs are **Stiff Diagrams** and **Piper Diagrams** 


## Using 


The usage is very simple. All you have to do is upload a `XSL`or `XSLX` table, and have the following columns: 

- station
- HCO3	
- CO3	
- SO4	
- Cl	
- Na	
- Ca	
- Mg	
- K

**Example table**



All diagrams can be downloaded. Just click the `download` button below each diagram. 


## Sources

I used a lot of sources. All the code is avaiable at my github account, and the charts an update from Saul Montoya's codes.
